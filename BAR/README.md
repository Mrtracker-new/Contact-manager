| **Temporary Credential Storage** | Store passwords, API keys, or access tokens that self-destruct after use |
| **Legal and Compliance** | Meet data retention policies by ensuring files are automatically deleted after required periods |
| **Personal Privacy** | Protect sensitive personal information with files that can't be recovered after deletion |
| **Secure Communication** | Exchange sensitive information with built-in destruction capabilities |
| **Corporate Environments** | Protect intellectual property and trade secrets with controlled access |

## üìù Best Practices

- **Password Security**: Use strong, unique passwords with a mix of character types
- **Security Parameters**: Set appropriate security constraints based on data sensitivity
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly back up non-sensitive data (remember that securely deleted files CANNOT be recovered)
- **Deadman Switch**: Be cautious with this feature - files will be permanently deleted if not accessed within the specified period
- **Device Scanning**: Scan removable devices before importing files to ensure integrity
- **Logging**: Check the logs in `~/.bar/logs` directory for troubleshooting
- **Hardware Binding**: Enable for critical files to prevent unauthorized access from different devices
- **Failed Attempts**: Remember that after 3 failed password attempts, files will be permanently deleted
- **Password Recovery**: If you forget your password, your data cannot be recovered - there is no backdoor or recovery mechanism
